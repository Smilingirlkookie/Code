          <h2>Get well soon friend </h2>  
            I know that you're not feeling well, and I 
            wanted to reach out and wish you a speedy recovery. 
            Even though we've only known each other for a month 
            I genuinely hope you get well soon. Take the time you 
            need to rest and recover. If there's anything I can do 
            to help or if you just need someone to talk to, feel 
            free to reach out. Wishing you good health and a 
            quick return to our study sessions.
            <br /><br />
            Take care,
          <br /><br />
